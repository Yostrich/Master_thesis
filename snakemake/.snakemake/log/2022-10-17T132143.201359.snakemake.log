MissingOutputException in rule createNotebook in line 1 of /mnt/c/Users/danis/Desktop/Thesis/pipeline_snakemake/workflow/rules/notebookStructuralProperties.smk:
Job Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
LUZ7_t5.plus.png completed successfully, but some output files are missing. 0
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
