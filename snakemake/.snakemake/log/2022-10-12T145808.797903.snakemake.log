NameError: The name ' map' is unknown in this context. Please make sure that you defined that variable. Also note that braces not used for variable access have to be escaped by repeating them, i.e. {{print $1}}, when formatting the following:

        #commonEnriched=$(awk '{{ print $2 }}' {input[2]} | awk '{{print $1, $2, $3, $14, $5, $17, $18}}' {input[0]})
        commonEnriched=$(awk -F "," 'NR==FNR { map[$1]=1;next } map[$2]==15 { print }' {input[2]} {input[0]})
