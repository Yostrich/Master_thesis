MissingOutputException in rule createNotebook in line 1 of /mnt/c/Users/danis/Desktop/Thesis/pipeline_snakemake/workflow/rules/notebookStructuralProperties.smk:
Job Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
