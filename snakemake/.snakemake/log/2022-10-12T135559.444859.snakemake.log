RuleException in rule getInformationFromOverlappingPeaks in line 44 of /mnt/c/Users/danis/Desktop/Thesis/pipeline_snakemake/workflow/rules/annotateTSS.smk:
NameError: The name 'print $1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6, $7, $8, $9, $10, $11, $12, $13, $14, $7/$14' is unknown in this context. Please make sure that you defined that variable. Also note that braces not used for variable access have to be escaped by repeating them, i.e. {{print $1}}, when formatting the following:

        commonEnriched=$(awk '{{ print $2 }}' {input[2]} | xargs -I {{}} awk -F "," '$14 == {{}} {{print $1, $2, $3, $14, $5, $17, $18}}' {input[0]})

        # paste -d ' ' <(echo "$commonEnriched") <(echo "$commonControl") |        # awk '{print $1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6, $7, $8, $9, $10, $11, $12, $13, $14, $7/$14}' |        # sort -g -k 2,2 | awk -v t=$Threshold -F " " '$15 > t {print }' > {output}
