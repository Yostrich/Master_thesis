RuleException in rule getGenomeFile in line 1 of /mnt/c/Users/danis/Desktop/Thesis/pipeline_snakemake/workflow/rules/annotateTTS.smk:
NameError: The name "'print $1,$2'" is unknown in this context. Please make sure that you defined that variable. Also note that braces not used for variable access have to be escaped by repeating them, i.e. {{print $1}}, when formatting the following:

            awk -v OFS='	' {'print $1,$2'} {input} > {output}
