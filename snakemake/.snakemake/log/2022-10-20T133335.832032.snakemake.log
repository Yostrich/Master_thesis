MissingOutputException in rule createNotebook in line 1 of /mnt/c/Users/danis/Desktop/Thesis/pipeline_snakemake/workflow/rules/notebookStructuralProperties.smk:
Job Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
TSS_LUZ7_t5/structural_properties/LUZ7_t5_stability.plus.png
TSS_LUZ7_t5/structural_properties/LUZ7_t5_stability.plus.csv completed successfully, but some output files are missing. 0
Removing output files of failed job createNotebook since they might be corrupted:

Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
