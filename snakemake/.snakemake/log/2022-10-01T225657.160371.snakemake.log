MissingOutputException in rule determineTranscriptionBoundries in line 6 of /mnt/c/Users/danis/Desktop/Thesis/pipeline_snakemake/workflow/Snakefile:
Job Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
LUZ100-test.txt completed successfully, but some output files are missing. 1
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
