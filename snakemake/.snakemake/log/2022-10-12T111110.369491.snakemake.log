Error in rule getOverlappingPeaksWithError:

    output: LUZ7_t5_overlapping_peaks_plus_1.plus.csv
    shell:
        
        errorPeaks=$(awk -F ',' '{print $1+1}' LUZ7_t5_remainingPeaks.plus.csv)

        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job getOverlappingPeaksWithError since they might be corrupted:
LUZ7_t5_overlapping_peaks_plus_1.plus.csv
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
