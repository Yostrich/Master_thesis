RuleException in rule addTotalReadsToCounts in line 39 of /mnt/c/Users/danis/Desktop/Thesis/pipeline_snakemake/workflow/rules/determineTranscriptionBoundries.smk:
NameError: The name "print $1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6, $7, $8 ,$9, $10, $11, $12, $13, $14, $15, '$total_mapped'" is unknown in this context. Please make sure that you defined that variable. Also note that braces not used for variable access have to be escaped by repeating them, i.e. {{print $1}}, when formatting the following:

        total_mapped=$(samtools view -c -F4 {input[1]})
        awk '{print $1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6, $7, $8 ,$9, $10, $11, $12, $13, $14, $15, '$total_mapped'}'         {input[0]}         > [output]
